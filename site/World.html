	<p>Kyiv: In a major development, air raid sirens blared across the Ukrainian capital after US President Joe Biden reached the war-embattled nation on Monday, February 20. Notably, this is the first visit of the US President to Ukraine ever since the war escalated earlier last year. The surprise visit comes days ahead when the country marks one year since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. "One year later Kyiv stands, Ukraine stands, and Democracy stands. America and the world stand with you. Kyiv has captured a part of my heart," said Biden during a presser.
	In a series of tweets, President Biden said, "As we approach the anniversary of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, I'm in Kyiv today to meet with President Zelenskyy and reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity."

Further, in a subsequent post, Biden lambasted his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and said Moscow had underestimated Ukraine and added he must have thought that it would not sustain his brutal attack.

"When Putin launched his invasion nearly one year ago, he thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided. He thought he could outlast us. But he was dead wrong," said Biden.</p>
